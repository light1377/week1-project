# 01 HTML CSS Git: Code Refactor project
## Contributors: Moral Meshkot

## Description:
Project aim was refactoring an aleady working webpage. The Horiseon webpage is a short basic layout of the front-end display of the website. Users will be able to use this page to understand how they can use internet and technology services in current times to best market and advertize their online business.

The project has used VS code to edit the html and css files for the webpage.

## Details:
As mentioned in the commit messages, html and css files have been refactored to make the webpage more user friendly and easier to navigate.

## Challenges faced:
At the beggining of the project I still needed to go through the content of the first week as the pace was very fast and I fell behind. The second challenge was a misunderstanding I had with the size of the boxes and number of lines in each box:\\ I assumed refactoring the page also meant we should have the same number of lines of text in each box, as the demo had shown but later realised that the text orientation was only dependent on the size of the screen.
So as a result, I tried changing everything from margins, padding, font-size, even changing the size of the images and so on to get exactly the number of lines and spacing as in the demo.
But after learning about flexbox or css grid in week 2 I realised my mistake. I will probably ask more questions from support contacts to clarify points I'm uncertain about in the next project.
